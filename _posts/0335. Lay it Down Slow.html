《Prison Break》结局，片尾跳到四年后，呈现每一个我们所爱的角色，他们最终去向何方，而此刻响起的音乐也配合着我的思绪缓缓展开。

以此文纪念MICHAEL SCOFIELD, LINCOLN BURROWS, DR. SARA TANCREDI,  ALEX MAHONE, Fernando Sucre..<!--more-->

if you got dreams in your heart
why don't you share them with me?
and if dreams don't come true
i'll make sure that
you're nightmares
are through

if you got pain in your heart
why don't you share it with me?
and we'll just wait and see
if it's half what it used to be

and lay it down slow
lay it down free
lay it down easy
but lay it on me

if you've got love in your heart
why don't you keep it with mine?
i can't promise a miracle
but i'll always be trying

and lay it down slow
lay it down free
lay it down easy
but lay it on me

lay it down easy
lay it on me

lay it down easy
but lay it on me
