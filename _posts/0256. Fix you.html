title: Fix you
---
一直想买全Coldplay的所有专辑，今天还是忍不住下载了X&amp;Y，这张我一直想听的专辑。

我不喜欢叫他们“酷玩”，这和他们的曲风完全不搭调，而且显得幼嫩。

Coldplay，还是依旧cold，冷艳的凄凉嗓音，从来没有浮躁的吼叫，却用这种凄凉，震撼我们的神经，甚至让我每一次听，都会想哭，为什么要这样的低沉，伤痛不是喊出来会好过一些吗？为什么不去宣泄。也许这样的cold才是真正的殇.. 伤入心脏。

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse.

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And the tears stream, down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I...

And the tears stream, down on your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you.
