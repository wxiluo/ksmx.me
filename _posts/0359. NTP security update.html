title: NTP security update

1. Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with a referenced time source.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4 authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "ntp" user.

<!--more-->

Note: NTP authentication is not enabled by default.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq command.

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the update, the ntpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
