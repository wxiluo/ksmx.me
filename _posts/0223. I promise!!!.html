title: I promise!!!
---
Today, I want to make a solemn promise.
Today, I want to make a serious vow.
Today, I want to make a life-changing commitment to myself.

I promise I will read English loudly and crazily for at least 20 minutes every morning.
I promise I will read English loudly and crazily for at least 5 minutes be fore and after every meal.
I promise I will read English loudly and crazily for at least 30 minutes before going to bed every night.
I promise I will read English loudly and crazily whenever I have a spare minute.<!--more-->

I will keep my promise because I know every single time I read English loudly and crazily, my English will improve.
I will keep my promise because I know the more I repeat, the deeper and more long-lasting my English ability will become.
Day by day, month by month, year by year, I will become better and better, stronger and stronger, smarter and smarter.

I will do it no matter if it rains, snows, or blows.
I will do it no matter if I feel tired, happy, or sad.
I will do it no mater how crazy my schedule is.

I will stick to my promise.
I will stick to my plan.
I will stick to my goal.

Nothing and nobody can stand in my way!
Nothing and nobody can discourage me!
Nothing and nobody can hinder my progress!
Nothing and nobody can take the place of my crazy self-improvement pursuit.

Whenever I think about my splendid plan, I'm full of power.
Whenever I think about my shining, successful future, I'm full of power.
Whenever I think about myself speaking eloquent English, I'm full of power.
Whenever I think about my capable, professional self, I'm full of power.

I promise I will speak standard, beautiful, and perfect English.
I promise English will become the solid foundation of mu future career.
I promise I won't let myself, my parents, and my country down.

I totally believe that all my effort, devotion, enthusiasm and hard work will pay off.
I totally believe that all the time, money, energy, and determination I've invested will produce generous returns.
I totally believe that all the difficulties, frustrations, failures and tears that I've endured will make me a stronger person.

Actions speak louder than words.
Storms make trees grow deeper roots.
Pain past is pleasure.
If I can dream it, I can do it.
Challenges make life more interesting.
It is impossible to defeat a person who never gives up.
Successful people never give up. People who give up can never succeed.

I'm born to succeed! I'm born to win!
I'm born to make miracles!

I will never give up! I will never give up!
I will never, never, never give up!
