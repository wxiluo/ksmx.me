title: Incredible Warranty Service - AppleCare
---
My battery was broken last week. The full charged capacity was 181 mAh. It only can support my macbook to run 10 minutes. It's interesting that iStat Menus shows the charge cycle is 60 times. I bought this 13'3 Macbook (Unibody)  on Feb 2009. Everything is OK within 2 years. This is the first hardware issue I met with Apple products. All Apple hardware comes with a one-year limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary telephone technical support. Obviously, I exceeded. Last year, Yihua, one of my team leader helped me buy the AppleCare, to extend my coverage to Feb 2012. What's a luck bird I am!

On last sunday, my girlfriend, fan and I went to Xidan Joy City Apple Store to repaire. Hundreds of persons were playing products there. It made the store crowd and very hot. I had a appointment, 3 pm. But I was there in 2 pm. So we went shopping, actually, just playing around in the 9 floors building until it's almost 3 pm.

"Hi, sir. Is there anything I can help?", a Apple engineer said. "Yes. My battery is broken.", I answered. "OK. First of all, let me help you to run a battery test.", he was connecting the wired link while recording. Somehow, my macbook network booting didn't work. He can't do the battery test for me unless he can install the origin Mac OS X on it. "Hi, sir. I have to let you know that battery is NOT covered by AppleCare. It's written in the service policy.", the engineer said. Oh, no! I never read the service policy just like anybody else. What's the fxxx. I should pay 870 yuan for replacing the battery. "Are you sure the battery warranty isn't covered by AppleCare?", I asked. "Yes. The battery is considered a "consumable" part and is NOT covered under AppleCare.".

I was NOT going to buy it! It's 870. Using those money to buy the next macbook is better, I think. "According to that you don't know battery isn't covered by AppleCare, we are going to replace it for free this time. But next time, you should pay the battery fee.", the engineer said while I'm considering.

Finally, I had a new battery for free! What's incredible warranty service. Apple don't only create amazing product, but also provide the best services for customers. I can't image this thing can happen in any other PC warranty center. Engineers. for most case, have to follow the company policy to provide limited help to customers. They don't want to or can't do more to improve the service, usually, is related with the rights they have. They can't replace battery for free, unless he/she pay for me. But it is happening in Apple Store, indeed.

I'm sure I will buy AppleCare for all my products in the future. I also would like to ask my friends to buy the incrediable service form Apple.
